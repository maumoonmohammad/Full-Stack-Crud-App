# Full-Stack-Crud-App

This is a beginner CRUD operation App where i have used react to develop the frontend and nodejs to develop the backend. The database used is mongodb. The user sees a form to create the user and 
upon hiting the allpost link on the left sidebar on the screen the user sees all the users stored in the database. The functionalities of this webapp inculde creating, reading, updating and deleting
a user from the database. Different API's have been created for all these functionalities. The users at the frontend can be seen in the form of a card. ANTD UI has been used also.
